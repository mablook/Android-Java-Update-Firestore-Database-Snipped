Snipped to save information in firestore using java. It should be implemented in private or public functions depending on the need.

I need to save the information in Firestore but without creating a listener, access is restricted traffic is not important in this case.
Whenever the token changes, I need to save it for future access.
A snipped should be improved, but works very well for the concept.

see my idea for Swift https://github.com/mablook/Xcode-Swift-Update-Firestore-Database-Snipped
